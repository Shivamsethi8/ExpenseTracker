# Expence Tracker

This is the expense tracking application.

We present an ‘Expense Tracker’ to efficiently manage house-old budget. Our system will allow user to keep track of their expenses. Some statistical analysis has to be done to be able to give users correct information on their expenses and help them spend better.

• Generates a report at the end of each month displaying the Income-Expense data through a graph, which is built using the Matplotlib library.
• Keeps historical data for the past 6 months, which can be viewed at any time

 Problem Statement:- 
 The problem of current generation population is that they can’t remember where all of the money they earned have gone and ultimately have to live while sustaining the little money they have left for their essential needs. In this time there is no such perfect solution which helps a person to track their daily expenditure easily and efficiently and notify them about the money shortage they have. For doing so they have to maintain long ledger’s or computer logs to maintain such data and the calculation is done manually by the user, which can sometime result in error leading to losses. Due to lack of a complete tracking system, there is a constant overload to rely on the daily entry of the expenditure and total estimation till the end of the month.
The objective of this system is: 
a) To keep track of daily expenses and budgeting; 
b) To save money for pre-defined expenses which will help planning on your future investments
